## Library Management System README

## Introduction
This Java program is a simple Library Management System that allows librarians to manage books and members, and members to borrow and return books. It includes features such as member registration, book addition/removal, fine calculation for overdue books, and more. This project is structured to be built and managed using Apache Maven.

## How to Build and Run
To build and run this program using Apache Maven, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alpha-rgb-cell/AP_Lab_Assignments.git
   cd LibraryManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Compile and Package the Application:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   java -jar target/LibraryManagementSystem.jar
   ```

4. The program will display a menu with options for librarian and member actions.

## Maven Structure
This project follows a standard Maven project structure:

- `src/main/java/org/example`: Contains the Java source code.
- `target`: Contains the compiled classes and the JAR file.
- `pom.xml`: The pom.xml file in Maven projects specifies project information, dependencies, build instructions, and other settings for consistent project management.

## Features

### Librarian Actions
1. **Register a Member**: Librarians can register a new member by providing their name, age, and phone number.

2. **Remove a Member**: Librarians can remove a member by specifying their name and phone number.

3. **Add a Book**: Librarians can add a new book by providing its title, author, and the number of copies.

4. **Remove a Book**: Librarians can remove a book by specifying its ID.

5. **View all Members**: Librarians can view a list of all registered members, along with their borrowed books and fines.

6. **View all Books**: Librarians can view a list of all books, grouped by title, and display the total copies and available copies.

### Member Actions
1. **List Available Books**: Members can see a list of available books.

2. **List My Books**: Members can see a list of books they have borrowed.

3. **Issue Book**: Members can borrow a book by specifying its ID. They can only borrow if they don't have a penalty, haven't reached the maximum limit of borrowed books, and if the book is available.

4. **Return Book**: Members can return a book by specifying its ID. If the book is returned late, a fine is calculated based on the delay and added to the member's penalty.

5. **Pay Fine**: Members can pay their fine to clear their penalty.

## Implementation Details
- The program uses object-oriented principles, with classes for `Book` and `Member`.
- Librarians and members are stored in `ArrayList` collections.
- A `Timer` is used to periodically calculate fines for overdue books.
- The due date for each book is set to 10 days from the issue date.
- Fines are calculated at a rate of 3 Rupees per day for overdue books.
- The program handles input validation to prevent invalid actions.

## Future Improvements
Here are some potential improvements for this program:
- Implement a database for data persistence.
- Add the ability to search for books by title, author, or other criteria.
- Allow members to renew borrowed books if they are not overdue.
- Implement a reservation system for books that are currently unavailable.

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
